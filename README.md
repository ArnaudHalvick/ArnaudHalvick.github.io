## 🚫 Problems I Solve

### "Our site has XXX pages but Google only indexes a few"

**The Problem:** E-commerce filter combinations create infinite URL variations, wasting crawl budget and causing duplicate content penalties.

**My Solution:** Smart parameter classification + robots.txt patterns + dynamic canonicalization that prevents URL explosions while keeping valuable facets indexable.

**What You Get:** Production-ready code or technical specifications for your dev team, handling edge cases that scale to millions of URLs.

### "Organic traffic dropped 30% and we don't know why"

**The Problem:** No diagnostic framework to identify whether the issue is content decay, keyword cannibalization, technical errors, or algorithm updates.

**My Solution:** Systematic measurement frameworks with KPI dashboards organized by cluster and funnel stage, plus diagnostic checklists for rapid troubleshooting.

**What You Get:** Custom diagnostic framework adapted to your business, with actionable next steps and priority ranking.

### "We spend a lot on content but rankings haven't moved"

**The Problem:** Content production without keyword clustering, search intent modeling, or topical authority strategy.

**My Solution:** Research-to-execution frameworks that convert keyword data into intent-led clusters, then translate clusters into hub & spoke content architecture.

**What You Get:** Complete keyword cluster strategy with content briefs, internal linking plan, and editorial calendar.
