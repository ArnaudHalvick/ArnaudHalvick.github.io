SEO SPECIALIST WHO CODES

I fix the technical problems most SEO agencies outsource.

Most SEO specialists can only do half the job—either they understand strategy but can't implement technical solutions, or they can code but lack SEO expertise. I do both. This means no recommendations that sit ignored by your dev team, and no technical implementations that ignore SEO fundamentals.

PROBLEMS I SOLVE

Problem 1: Your site has thousands of pages but Google only indexes a few

The Issue: E-commerce filter combinations create infinite URL variations, wasting crawl budget and triggering duplicate content penalties. Your site has 50,000 product pages but only 500 are indexed.

My Solution: I implement smart parameter classification, robots.txt patterns, and dynamic canonicalization that prevents URL explosions while keeping valuable filter pages indexable. This is production-ready code that handles edge cases and scales to millions of URLs.

What You Get: Working implementation or detailed technical specifications for your dev team, plus documentation of the SEO logic behind each decision.

Problem 2: Organic traffic dropped 30 percent and we don't know why

The Issue: No diagnostic framework to identify whether the problem is content decay, keyword cannibalization, technical errors, or algorithm updates. Your agency gives generic recommendations without systematic analysis.

My Solution: I build measurement frameworks with KPI dashboards organized by cluster and funnel stage, plus diagnostic checklists that identify the root cause. Then I implement the fixes—both technical and strategic.

What You Get: Custom diagnostic framework adapted to your business model, actionable next steps with priority ranking, and hands-on implementation of solutions.

Problem 3: We spend a lot on content but rankings haven't moved

The Issue: Content production without keyword clustering, search intent modeling, or topical authority strategy. Publishing volume without strategic direction means wasted budget and no ranking improvements.

My Solution: I build research-to-execution frameworks that convert keyword data into intent-led clusters, then translate clusters into hub and spoke content architecture with internal linking plans.

What You Get: Complete keyword cluster strategy, content briefs for each hub and spoke piece, internal linking plan, and editorial calendar ready to execute.

- Crawl budget optimization for large catalogs
- Dynamic canonicalization strategies

WHY CLIENTS HIRE ME

Rare Combination: Most SEO agencies outsource either development work or strategy work. I do both in-house, which means faster execution and better results.

Production Ready: I write code that handles edge cases and scales in production, not tutorials that break under real-world conditions.

Business Focused: Every technical decision ties directly to crawl budget efficiency, conversion rates, or ranking improvements. I speak both developer and business language.

Clear Communication: Transparent reasoning through documentation and detailed explanations. You'll understand not just what I did, but why it works.

Proven Results: 7 years of continuous client work with 100 percent job success score. I've solved these problems dozens of times across different industries and tech stacks.
